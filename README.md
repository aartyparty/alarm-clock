# Simple JS Alarm Clock

## Project Info

Built an Alarm Clock. At it's minimum, this alarm clock shows the current time, has the ability to set alarm, and gives an indication that an alarm has gone off.

## Build/Usage Instructions

### Install

`npm install`

### Run

`gulp prod`

### Open

`dist/index.html` in browser

## Next Steps

### Javascript
* Allow user to turn an alarm on/off
* Set alarm to "off" after it has gone off
* Add ability to snooze an alarm
* Allow user to delete alarm
* Sort alarm list in order from (12AM - 12PM)

### Design
* For tablet/desktop, come up with a better approach for listing alarms
* Redo animation for indicating whether an alarm has gone off; there's tons of cooler stuff to do than just changing color (Rotations/Play Sounds/SVG animations)
